Step 1
Welcome to the Registration Form project! Start by adding the !DOCTYPE html declaration at the top of the document so the browser knows what type of document it's reading.

Step 2
Below the DOCTYPE, add an html element with a lang attribute set to en, so that you have a place to start putting some code.

Step 3
Next, add opening and closing head and body tags within the html element.

Step 4
Add a title and a meta element to the head. Give your project a title of Registration Form, and give a charset attribute with a value of UTF-8 to your meta element.

Step 5
Nest a self-closing link element within the head element. Give it a rel attribute with value of stylesheet and an href attribute with a value of styles.css.

Step 6
Within the body, provide a heading context for the content, by adding an h1 with the text Registration Form.

Step 7
Below the heading, use the following text within a paragraph element to encourage users to register:

Please fill out this form with the required information

Step 8
The vh unit stands for viewport height, and is relative to 1% of the height of the viewport.

It is time to spruce the project up with some CSS. Begin by giving the body a width of 100%, and a height of 100vh.

Step 9
Now, get rid of the horizontal scroll-bar, by setting the body default margin added by some browsers to 0.

Step 10
That is better. Now, make the background easy on the eyes, by changing the body background-color to #1b1b32. Then, to see the text, change the color to #f5f6f7.

Step 11
As suggested by the title, you are creating a form. So, after the p element, insert a form with an action attribute targeting https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org.

Step 12
The method attribute specifies how to send form-data to the URL specified in the action attribute. The form-data can be sent via a GET request as URL parameters (with method="get") or via a POST request as data in the request body (with method="post").

Set the method attribute to send your form data via a POST request.

Step 13
As the form will have three distinct sections, add three fieldset elements within the form element.

Step 14
The first fieldset will hold name, email, and password fields. Start by adding four label elements to the first fieldset.

Step 15
Add the following text to the label elements:

Enter Your First Name:
Enter Your Last Name:
Enter Your Email:
Create a New Password:

Step 16
The rem unit stands for root em, and is relative to the font size of the html element.

As label elements are inline by default, they are all displayed side by side on the same line, making their text hard to read. To make them appear on separate lines, add display: block to the label element, and add a margin of 0.5rem 0, to separate them from each other.
